# Getting Started with VitePress

VitePress is a **static site generator** designed for creating fast, content-focused websites. Built on top of Vite and Vue 3, it offers an excellent developer experience with lightning-fast builds.

## Why Choose VitePress?

### 🎯 **Built for Content**
Unlike general-purpose frameworks, VitePress is specifically designed for:
- Documentation sites
- Blogs and content sites  
- Marketing pages
- Knowledge bases

### ⚡ **Vite-Powered Performance**
- **Instant hot reload** during development
- **Optimized builds** for production
- **Modern JavaScript** with ES modules

## Key Features

### 📝 **Markdown-First**
Write content in markdown with powerful extensions:

```markdown
::: tip
This is a tip box!
:::

::: warning
This is a warning!
:::

::: danger
This is dangerous!
:::
```

### 🎨 **Vue Components in Markdown**
Mix Vue components seamlessly with markdown:

```vue
<script setup>
import { ref } from 'vue'
const count = ref(0)
</script>

<button @click="count++">
  Count: {{ count }}
</button>
```

### 🔧 **Simple Configuration**
Minimal setup in `.vitepress/config.js`:

```javascript
export default {
  title: 'My Site',
  description: 'My awesome site',
  themeConfig: {
    nav: [
      { text: 'Home', link: '/' },
      { text: 'Blog', link: '/blog/' }
    ]
  }
}
```

```
my-site/
├── .vitepress/
│   └── config.js
├── blog/
│   ├── index.md
│   └── my-first-post.md
